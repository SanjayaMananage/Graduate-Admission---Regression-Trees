# Graduate-Admission---Regression-Trees

Here I considered the Graduate Admission 2 data set(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions). This
data set is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective. The data set contains several parameters
which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The sample size is 400. Take Chance.of.Admit as
the quantitative response variable. Among the predictors, Research is a qualitative variable and treat University Rating as a
quantitative variable. Take all the data as training data. For all the models, use leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)
to compute the estimated test MSE.
